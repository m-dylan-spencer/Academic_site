abstract: Electroreceptors with sensitivity in the microvolt range, which mainly function
  to detect live prey, are well known in phylogenetically old fishes and some amphibians1–4.
  In African mormyriform and South American gymnotiform fishes this sense has evolved
  to an active system using an electric organ as a source for impedance measurement
  of the environment and for communication5,6. Electroreception in higher vertebrates
  has not previously been reported. Here we establish that the platypus, the Australian
  nocturnal diving monotreme, can locate and avoid objects on the basis of d.c. fields.
  High–frequency sensitivity to a.c. could allow the detection of muscle activity
  of animals, such as crustaceans, which are preyed on by the platypus. Recordings
  of cortical evoked potentials showed that the bill of the platypus, previously considered
  to be exclusively mechanoreceptive7–9, is also an electroreceptive organ with behavioural
  and electrophysiological sensitivity of ∼50 µV cm−1. Several lines of evidence suggest
  that electroreception has evolved independently in this monotreme.
