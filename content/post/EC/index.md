## Perception vs. Obsvered Reality

This extra credit opportunity is worth **10 points**. The points will be added to your **lowest quiz grade**. 

For this assignment I want to create a visual representation of where we as a class *perceive* the most "dangerous" areas of Columbia, SC to be. The locations we choose will be mapped and then compared to the *real* or observed locations of crime in the city. 

I will map everyone's chosen location (as a point location) and the observed crime in the city aggregated to the census tract. Census tracts are often used to represent neighborhoods in crime research. Once I have all of the data compiled I will create an interactive map and share the results with the class. Do you think your perception will match reality?

## Instructions

If you choose to complete this extra credit opportunity you must do the following.

1) Go to the following link for Googlemaps: <https://goo.gl/maps/nc3QZcfzY7uzPUN77>.

2. Within Columbia, SC city limits find a location that you perceive to be dangerous. This location can be a place you have heard about, visited, live, drove-by, etc. To find the address of your chosen location simply click the map and a pointer will appear. Listed to the left of your screen an information box will appear. Copy the address as it is shown below in the image.
