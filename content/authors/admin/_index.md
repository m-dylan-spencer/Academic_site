Dr. Dylan Spencer is an assistant professor of criminology in the School of Psychology, Sociology, and Rural Studies at South Dakota State University. His research primarily focuses on conservation-related crime, with a keen interest in applying spatial and quantitative methodologies to address various aspects of this field. His areas of expertise encompass wildlife crime, illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing, evidence-based crime prevention, and the development of equitable and effective policing strategies.

As a quantitative researcher, Dr. Spencer extensively works with large datasets sourced from diverse agencies and organizations. He employs a wide array of analytical techniques, both spatial and non-spatial, to derive insights and draw conclusions from these datasets. His research contributions not only shed light on the dynamics of conservation-related crime but also inform policy interventions aimed at mitigating its impacts.

Through his interdisciplinary approach, Dr. Spencer seeks to bridge the gap between criminology and conservation science, contributing to a deeper understanding of the complex interactions between human behavior and environmental degradation. His work holds significant implications for wildlife conservation efforts and the sustainability of natural resources.
